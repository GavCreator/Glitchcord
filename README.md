### Making Your Own Custom Discord Theme Using These Files
If you want to download this repo and customize it, go for it. I do however ask you to remove my designs in your own theme, such as my Home Icon, and Logo for the top of the client.

I also recommend you download the other css files as I may make more changes that you may not like, and could possibly even break your own design

If you are struggling with customizing it within the files, I recommend you use [BDEditor](https://bdeditor.dev/)
